			<p>I am saddened that this project appears to be ending. I've had this thing going for about three years now, probably three and a quarter, and throughout that I have tried (what I believe to be unsuccessfully) to get my point about sexuality across. What is that point? I don't really know - I started this project just as a casual blog, and it developed into the complete clusterfuck it is today. I deleted the old stories because they didn't really fit the style I had going forward with this project, and were pretty terrible.</p>
			<p>At this point i gotta tell you: I'm mostly drunk. I've had about half a bottle of red wine, and am still going to see if anything good came out of me; so I apologize if my writing is bad. Also I won't be editing this story at all.</p>
			<p>Previously I have tried to publish stories weekly, and I haven't lately as I haven't had enough ideas to publish weekly, and the last time I published before this story specifically was like three weeks ago.</p>
			<p>Again, I have tried to make this blog somewhat... nope that's not going anywhere.</p>
			<p>Ten or so minutes ago before I started writing this story, I thought of it being a sort of surrealish explination about what my point to these stories is, but I can't even think of that. It's not like the alcohol is impairing my thought process, just my typing skills, I literally cannot think of the point I am trying to get across with these stories. Actually, I think I never even had one. When writing, I always just type and ask questions later - the same with this project. There is a reason as to why the stories are in no specific order - it's because I never had any specific plot line or anything.</p>
			<p>I will continue writing, and I promise I will try to lead this project somewhere, but I can't really see any possibility as to where it will go.</p>
			<p>Actually, I think I can decifer some meaning to these stories, it's that everyone is the same, more or less. I can remember a point in time when I was still in a relationship/friends with Tyler, where I wanted to impregnate him. Yes, actually. I remember him conforting a kid or something, he was sitting on the back of his feet, with his right hand on the kid'ss left shoulder. I can't really remember the context to that, nor can I remember why the kid was there, but as he was conforting the kid, I remember thinking, "He would make such a good mother". Well not literally that, I didn't say it, but that's what I thought, and also I thought the word "father" not "mother" but understood that in this context they would mean the same thing.</p>
			<p>Nobody knows what causes queerness or whatever, and probably never will, but throughout this project I have learned that it doesn't really make a difference. Except in the cases of asexuality and stuff, everyone has the same reproduction and love that everyone else has. Gayness and stuff just comes from... a birth defect , or whatever. Not from a genetic something because that makes absolutely no fucking sense, but some kind of minor change that causes some people to be attracted to someting that isn't just the other gender. I apoligise for my writing - I'm completely drunk right now.</p>
			<p>I hope that whomever finds these stories learns something frm them, because I fear that person won't.</p>
			<p>I'm gonna go take a bath and then go to bed.</p>
