Jessica was in the backyard talking to Max Thornhill, a classmate of ours. "I think that she's a good fit for you, but I just think she's a total- Oh hey, Anthony."
"Hello, Jessica. Hello, Max." I said. "What were you guys talking about?"
"I got a girlfriend" Max said. "She's a freshmen - her name is Samantha, you might know her."
"I do not." I said.
"Don't take this the wrong way, but who are you?" Max asked me.
"Oh, Jessica and I have known each other for a few years, we went to middle school together. I know you though, you're Max Thornhill."
"Oh cool. Wait, how do you know who I am?"
"I learn names and faces really easily, I must've overheard someone saying your name to you or something."
"I know Samantha," Jessica said, "Not very well though, we just have history and math together. I was just saying how I think she's a total-"
"Okay, Jessica" Max said, quite annoyed, "You don't like her. I do though, she's really nice."
"So you're not at all interested in her because she's a D cup?"
"That's a loaded question and you know it, Jessica."
"Oh right, you're speech and debate, I forgot I can't have a petty argument against you." Jessica jeered.
"Well, anyway," Max said, "Nice to meet you, Anthony" He fist-bumped me,
"You two wanna get a hot dog or something?"
