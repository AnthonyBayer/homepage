			<p>Jessica opened the door to meet me. "Hey, what's up."</p>
			<p>"Can I come in" I asked, in a manner that must have set a mild amount of worry into Jessica.</p>
			<p>She hesitated - "Yeah, sure" She said.</p>
			<p>I walked in past her, and into the living room just past a short hallway with one door. I stopped thinking I was invading.</p>
			<p>Jessica shut the door, "What's up?" she asked.</p>
			<p>"Can I," I stumbled, "Sit somewhere?"</p>
			<p>Jessica paused again, "Yeah, sure." She led me to a couch. I sat down.</p>
			<p>"What's up?" Jessica asked.</p>
			<p>I stumbled again: "I, wa- Actu.. Tyle-.. Sorry what?"</p>
			<p>"What?" Jessica tried to understand what I was saying.</p>
			<p>"Sorry, I'm not doing so hot."</p>
			<p>"I can tell" Jessica said.</p>
			<p>I inhaled a lot of air, and sighed. Jessica sat down on a smaller couch ajacent to the one I was on.</p>
			<p>"Did something happen?" Jessica asked, even though that was mostly not needed. "Yeah." I said. Her question mostly asked me "What happened?"</p>
			<p>"It's just... My half brother/boyfriend-not-boyfriend/couleague shot himself."</p>
			<p>Jessica kept looking at me, "Oh." She said, trying to be respectful and sympathetic.</p>
			<p>Jessica paused for a second - "I have no idea how to respond to that - I'm... sorry." She shook her head lightly.</p>
			<p>Jessica wanted to ask "When?" out of curiosity, but held back.</p>
			<p>I sat in silence looking at Jessica. I felt like she was being exceptionally nice to me.</p>
			<p>Like, I never came out to her, I somehow thought that she would be hung up on that, but she wasn't.</p>
			<p>And now I'm hung up on that.</p>
			<p>I kept looking at Jessica, but not really staying focused on her.</p>
			<p>"Are you okay?" Jessica asked me.</p>
			<p>I snapped back into reality, "Yeah, why?"</p>
			<p>"I don't know, you were just a little out of it." She said back to me.</p>
			<p>We looked at each other for a quick second. Jessica was wearing beaten light blue jeans, a purple-blue shirt and a white-colored heavy woll scarf.</p>
			<p>"How are you?" she asked me.</p>
			<p>"...Fine." I responded in a sad tone.</p>
			<p>I exhaled through my nose, Jessica somewhat hung her head in respect.</p>
			<p>"Do you want to talk about it?" She asked.</p>
			<p>"No, not really."</p>
			<p>She started to tear up herself. "...Do you want anything?"</p>
			<p>"No."</p>
			<p>"Should I leave you alone?"</p>
			<p>"Yes, please."</p>
			<p>She respectfully got up, and what seemed like in slow motion, walked away down a hallway and into a room.</p>
