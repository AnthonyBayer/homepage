			<p>I was nervous, even though I wasn't the one who had done something wrong. My heart raced along with my and my parents' feet.</p>
			<p>The halls were empty. They were lit the same amount as every day, but it seemed brighter since it was night.</p>
			<p>The doors became closer together, then a bit farther towards the end of the hallway. My dad didn't slow down when he opened a door. The door to Ms. Northington's office. My mom and I followed in. Ms Northington looked up at us and said, "Yeah, sure... come in."</p>
			<p>"You seem to be busy, so I'll make this short." He took out his phone and pulled up a photo, "Do you see this?" He held the photo in front of her.</p>
			<p>She barely even moved. She just sat there with a straight face. "He pointed to part of the photo, "That's you... which you already know, there's no reason for me to say that, but you get the point."</p>
			<p>She kept here straight face, "What do you want?" She asked in a semi-monotone voice.</p>
			<p>"Nothing yet, but let me get this clear: we own you. If you ever fail to follow our instructions, this photo will be released in a very public matter. Do you understand?"</p>
			<p>She kept her sight on my dad, "Yes" she said, in an increasingly stern voice.</p>
			<p>"Good." He amused,  "Have fun sleeping tonight."</p>
