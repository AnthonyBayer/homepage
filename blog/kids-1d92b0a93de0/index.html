			<p>This story is timed to the following song for almost all readers. Please play the song and read along with the lyrics.</p>

			<p>I laid on my bed, staring up at the ceiling.</p>
			<p>I listened to the sounds of kids playing in the background, and the inaccurate upbeat tune fade in.</p>
			<p>I felt what could be best described as panic, the predecessor to fear.</p>
			<p>The fear of nostalgia.</p>
			<p>The melody started playing. I felt as if this was somehow more accurate to what I knew the song was going to be about, even though I knew it wasn't, and I had listened to this song almost a hundred times.</p>
			<p>I tried to relax.</p>
			<blockquote>Kids are sad, the sky is blue</blockquote>
			<blockquote>There are monsters in the spare bedroom</blockquote>
			<blockquote>Kids grow up, and move away</blockquote>
			<blockquote>They closed the plant and the mall arcade</blockquote>
			<blockquote>Kids are sad, their parents, too</blockquote>
			<blockquote>Kids get high in the spare bedroom</blockquote>
			<blockquote>We grow up and move away</blockquote>
			<blockquote>The seasons pass, but the monsters stay</blockquote>
			<p>I felt my skin tingle.</p>
			<p>I felt as if time was real, as if I could get it back, go back and fix what I did wrong in my life, to other people.</p>
			<p>I felt like I could cry</p>
			<blockquote>Kids are sad, the sky is blue</blockquote>
			<blockquote>There are monsters in the spare bedroom</blockquote>
			<blockquote>Kids grow up, and move away</blockquote>
			<blockquote>They closed the plant and the mall arcade</blockquote>
			<blockquote>Kids are sad, their parents, too</blockquote>
			<blockquote>Kids get high in the spare bedroom</blockquote>
			<blockquote>We grow up and move away</blockquote>
			<blockquote>The seasons pass, but the monsters stay</blockquote>
			<blockquote>Kids are sad, the sky is blue</blockquote>
			<blockquote>There are monsters in the spare bedroom</blockquote>
			<blockquote>Kids grow up, and move away</blockquote>
			<blockquote>They closed the plant and the mall arcade</blockquote>
			<blockquote>Kids are sad, their parents, too</blockquote>
			<blockquote>Kids get high in the spare bedroom</blockquote>
			<blockquote>We grow up and move away</blockquote>
			<blockquote>The seasons pass, but the monsters stay</blockquote>
			<p>The slowly increasing severity of the song made me even more panicked.</p>
			<p>I listened to the ensamble of the West L.A. Children's Chrior as they probably didn't know the meaning of what they were singing about.</p>
			<p>The children had stopped singing, but the song was harsh, and kept inching up on me.</p>
			<p>But then suddently, it was calm; or at least that's what it was intended to be, I just broke out crying.</p>
			<p>I missed my friends, my teachers, my normal life.</p>
			<p>I wondered what the pourpose of this section is, it seemed out of place at the time.</p>

			<p>I started singing the lyrics:</p>
			<p>"Kids are sad, the sky is blue</p>
			<p>"There are monsters in the spare bedroom</p>
			<p>"Kids grow up, and move away</p>
			<p>"They closed the plant and the mall arcade</p>
			<p>"Kids are sad, their parents, too</p>
			<p>"Kids get high in the spare bedroom</p>
			<p>"We grow up and move away</p>
			<p>"The seasons pass, but the monsters stay"</p>
			<p>I started to stop crying. I hadn't gotten over what I was crying about, but I knew it was neccicary.</p>
			<p>The song was about being pushed out of childhood unprepared, without wanting it, and so was my crying.</p>
			<p>The music faded out.</p>
