<a href="../../signatures">How to verify signatures</a>.</pre>
			<p>I was almost late. The appointment was set at 3 and it was 2:58. I parked my car in the half-empty lot outside a small building that was so modern it looked like it was built five days ago.</p>
			<p>I walked in the front glass door to meet a receptionist at a desk typing away at her computer. The door hissed shut behind me. The receptionist looked up at me and smiled and then asked for my key. I took a key looking USB device and plugged it into a black box sitting on top of the low frosted-glass desk she was sitting at. She checked the identity on the key, and the looked back up at me, "your appointment is in room 3 down the hall.</p>
			<p>I took my key back and walked down the hall and into the room. There was a woman sitting at the end of a wooden table, a guard with a fully automatic rifle standing next to the door, and Mr. and Ms. Garrison sitting down next to each other on the side farther from the door. They looked at me, I looked back at them. I sat down at a chair on the nearer side and, set backpack on the ground, and set up my laptop on the table.</p>
			<p>I quickly inspected the table further. It was pill shaped and made of various wooden planks about two inches thick, and was smooth with no seams but still had some texture.</p>
			<p>"Okay," the woman at the end the table said, "now that we're all here we can get started." She took out a sleek black thin box and slid it in the center of the table. "This meeting will be recorded and a copy will be sent to each party as well as a signature from the insurance company and the other parties involved verifying its authenticity."</p>
			<p>Everyone knew that already but it still had to be said for reasons. The woman read off a peice of paper with monospace text in front of her: "This meeting is to discuss the postmortem affairs of Tyler Garrison; ID number 82b0259a. Please go around the table clockwise starting with me and identify yourself for the record. I am Marissa Blanc, ID number 67a0ff27 the insurance agent for the Los Angeles area."</p>
			<p>It was my turn, "I am Anthony Bayer, ID number c105f93a. I am a distant relative of the Garrisons and was Tyler's close friend."</p>
			<p>"I am Lindsey Garrison, ID number 28f93810, the mother and parent of Tyler."</p>
			<p>"I am William Garrison, ID number b40a0ff2. the father and parent of Tyler."</p>
			<p>Marissa looked at Mr. Garrison and smirked.</p>
			<p>"Okay," Marissa said, "let's continue to item one: insurance payout. Me. And Ms. Garrison, since you are the rightful guardians of Tyler, you will receive the full $25 million payout as our investigation has found no wrongdoing." Marissa typed a few things on her laptop, "the funds have been sent to your account."</p>
			<p>This was hard to do. It was impersonal. We were two minutes into the meeting and we were already halfway done.</p>
			<p>"And now onto the second item on the docket: inheritance."</p>
			<p>Oh fuck, now I know why I'm here. Mr. And Ms. Garrison knew why too.</p>
			<p>"Anthony," Marissa said to me, "Tyler named you his sole next of kin on July 24th 2018 at 22:47:54 GMT. We have not received any newer contracts signed by Tyler that changes his inheritance. If any party has a contract signed with his PGP identity that they would like to add to the record or prove a newer change please provide it now. Any contracts will be included in the final record." Marissa looked up at us to see if we were going to give her anything.</p>
			<p>I looked over at the Garrisons, they looked so angry at me, but they weren't; they understood what happened; they knew what he felt in that moment. We kept looking at each other, there wasn't a word to describe what we were feeling, it could best described as a cold empathy.</p>
			<p>"Are you guys okay?" Marissa asked us, not really understanding much.</p>
			<p>"Yeah," Mr. Garrison said, "we're fine."</p>
			<p>"Okay then. Anthony will inherit the following properties: a 2018 Dodge challenger, a 2016 Ford Explorer, one blown up house in Beverly hills, and a backpack confiscated from the Garrisons home." Marissa typed a few things on her laptop. "The properties have been transferred to Anthony."</p>
