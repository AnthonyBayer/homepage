			<p>"He's a solid ten," Samantha said, "no doubt about it."</p>
			<p>"Who?" I asked. "Bryce Pendren."</p>
			<p>"Why are we talking about this?" Kyle complained. "Why, does it make you uncomfortable?"</p>
			<p>"Sorta, yeah. It's not the guy aspect, it's the fact that he's a person in the school, and one of our teammates. If you were talking about a celebrity, I'd be fine."</p>
			<p>"How about we change the subject." I suggested.</p>
			<p>"Sure," Jessica said, "what do you think of the game last night?"</p>
			<p>"We won, but it was terrible. It's not that we were winning, they were just loosing more."</p>
			<p>"Remember that time you threw the ball at the back of my head." Kyle jeered.</p>
			<p>"Yeah…" I said. "Okay, I missed someone else, I was trying to pass it to Jessica here, but she moved, and I panicked."</p>
			<p>"Oh." Jessica said sheepishly.</p>
			<p>"We are really bad at talking today." I said. "Yeah, sorry" Samantha said. "I went to bed really late this morning."</p>
			<p>"Why?" I asked.</p>
			<p>"I was just, having trouble sleeping."</p>
			<p>"Are you okay?" Kyle dug. Samantha looked up at him, "Oh yeah, I'm fine."</p>
			<p>"No you're not." "Yeah I am." Samantha started crying. Jessica and I exchanged looks, then looked at Samantha, then exchanged looks again.</p>
			<p>"Are you crying?"</p>
			<p>"Ye- Yeah…"</p>
			<p>"You're not okay."</p>
			<p>"No I'm not, okay! Just… Sorry."</p>
			<p>We sat in silence for ten seconds, then we continued to eat respectfully while Samantha cried.</p>
			<p>About a minute later, Samantha started talking, we all put down our food.</p>
			<p>"I was up all night crying."</p>
			<p>"How come?" Kyle asked.</p>
			<p>"Stop!! Just, shut up."</p>
			<p>"Okay."</p>
			<p>Samantha took another five seconds to calm down.</p>
			<p>"I feel terrible, for just, lying to you for so long. And it's not that I wanted to, I just…"</p>
			<p>We were all ears.</p>
			<p>"I'll just say it. I'm gay."</p>
			<p>Actually, I just realized you don't have the necessary prerequisites to this story, well, you'll figure it out.</p>
			<p>We sat in science for a solid minute. Samantha did not move at all.</p>
			<p>"How long have you known?" Kyle asked.</p>
			<p>"Shut the fuck up, Kyle." Another twenty seconds passed.</p>
			<p>"I knew since I was twelve."</p>
			<p>"So… Four years. Wow, four years you knew this."</p>
			<p>"Yes."</p>
			<p>"So you asked me out, knowing full well you were gay."</p>
			<p>"Yes."</p>
			<p>"So the past year, of us going on dates, hanging out with each other, fucking each other. You never liked me."</p>
			<p>"Not in the slightest."</p>
			<p>"Jesus fucking Christ man."</p>
			<p>"Yeah, I know.</p>
