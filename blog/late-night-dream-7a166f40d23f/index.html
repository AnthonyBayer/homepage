			<p>Tyler's eyes reflected the bright images from the mid-sized TV twenty feet in front of him. His eyes quickly darted across random angles looking at different parts of the screen. The noise from the TV was muffled.</p>
			<p>The camera moved back to reveal Tyler's greater face and neck.</p>
			<p>Tyler laughed for a quick couple seconds. His laugh could be best described as childish, and deep-pitched.</p>
			<p>The camera moved back more to reveal Tyler's surroundings - he was sitting on the right two-thirds of Anthony's lap.</p>
			<p>The light from the TV lit up the excessive wood furniture and flooring in both the equally small living room and kitchen behind the two.</p>
			<p>The couch they were sitting on was four-person wide and the only one in the room. Anthony's hands were fermly on Tyler's body. the right hand on Tyler's right thigh, the left holding Tyler's body close.</p>
			<p>The two laughed again. Anthony's laugh had a lower frequency than Tyler's.</p>
			<p>The camera kept moving out. The light from the TV reflected on the large window next to the door on the left.</p>
			<p>Tyler laughed again, then Anthony partly from the joke from the TV, and because of the pressure from Tyler.</p>
			<p>The bright lights from the TV and the muffled sound kept the room occupied.</p>
