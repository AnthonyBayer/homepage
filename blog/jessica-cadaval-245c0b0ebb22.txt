"Are you okay?" Jessica asked me.
I snapped back into reality, "Yeah, why?"
"I don't know, you were just a little out of it." She said back to me.
We looked at each other for a quick second. Jessica was wearing beaten light blue jeans, a purple-blue shirt and a white-colored heavy woll scarf.
"How are you?" she asked me.
"...Fine." I responded in a sad tone.
I exhaled through my nose, Jessica somewhat hung her head in respect.
"Do you want to talk about it?" She asked.
"No, not really."
She started to tear up herself. "...Do you want anything?"
"No."
"Should I leave you alone?"
"Yes, please."
She respectfully got up, and what seemed like in slow motion, walked away down a hallway and into a room.
