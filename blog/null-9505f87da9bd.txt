I think one of the most interesting moments in my life was when I confessed who I was to Ms. Northington
I told her what my family did for a living. She didn’t know already like a lot of the other kids in similar places; she kept it a secret. In that moment I think that we both connected beyond what we had before with anyone else.
This was when she told me about the complaints that Tyler’s parents made, and what Tyler himself didn’t say.
And I think, even for just a few seconds, she actually got it, she actually felt what I had been feeling for years. She got what it was like to finallyfind someone I could actually connect with, who didn’t just say that people are more accepting or something.
I don’t know why.
And that was the first time I saw a grown woman cry.
