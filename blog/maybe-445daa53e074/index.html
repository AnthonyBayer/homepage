			<p>Kyle sat to the left of me on the right side of a king bed. I could hear the faint sound of loud music from the ongoing party through the door to the room.</p>
			<p>"Thank you." a very drunk Kyle said.</p>
			<p>"For what?"</p>
			<p>"All this - everything really."</p>
			<p>"You're welcome."</p>
			<p>There was silence for a nonspecific amount of time.</p>
			<p>"Are you gay?" Kyle asked.</p>
			<p>"Yes." I answered.</p>
			<p>"Ah." Kyle said.</p>
			<p>The music continued playing.</p>
			<p>"There's this dream that I keep getting, and I hate it." Kyle said. "It's like, it's when like, we're at your house for some party, and like I follow you up into your room, and then we drink beer and then you fuck me." Kyle drunkenly said.</p>
			<p>"Oh" I said.</p>
			<p>"Yeah..." Kyle said; he looked into his eyes - I kept looking into his without changing expression. Kyle couldn't really focus on my face, and kept looking off into the distance behind me or slowly shifting his eyes around.</p>
			<p>"Can you kiss me?" Kyle asked.</p>
			<p>I thought about it, "No."</p>
			<p>Kyle grabbed my arm, I pushed him off with little effort.</p>
			<p>Then he leaned in to try and kiss me anyway, I held him back, "No, Kyle, stop." I said, "You're drunk, stop."</p>
			<p>"But I wanna." Kyle complained.</p>
			<p>"No - it's not like you'll remember it anyway." I rebutted.</p>
