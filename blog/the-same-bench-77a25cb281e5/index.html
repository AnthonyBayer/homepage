			<p>"How did you find me?" I asked as I heard someone sit down next to me. My friend had warned me he was approaching about fifteen seconds ago. I hoped that he was the one that just sat down and I hadn't just creeped some random person out.</p>
			<p>"How do you think?" Anthony said; I recognized his voice almost before he started talking. A weird butterly-in-my-stomach feeling shot through me, it was neither good nor bad. "I don't know" I responded, "I made it as impossible as I could for you to do that."</p>
			<p>"I am aware," Anthony said, I realized that he had been looking for a while, or at least had looked a lot, "but I'm always able to find something if I want to." He finished. I turned to a new page in my sketchbook and started drawing Anthony's face as I remembered it in order to aid my memory.</p>
			<p>Neither he nor I looked at each other; I could sense him studying me, and realized I was guilty of doing the same. "What are you drawing?" I asked. "You'll see." I said, I didn't want to tell him for some stupid dramatic effect. I sat in silence waiting for him to talk. "Are you going to say something to me?" I asked, I could feel him stammering for a few seconds before he started talking: "When I first found out that you would be here right now, for some reason there was some part of me that really wanted to talk to you again, I knew that I shouldn't but figured that there would be no harm in doing so. I had all of these things that I wanted to say to you, but now I don't want to, I can't even think of them."</p>
			<p>I listened.</p>
			<p>"I wanted to do the same thing up until a year back." I said. There were plenty of times I knew where he was, I am not sure if he wanted me to find him or not.</p>
			<p>"What stopped you?" He asked me.</p>
			<p>"I just stopped thinking about you." I said. I kept drawing.</p>
			<p>I couldn't tell what his reaction to that answer was. I could tell he was very indecisive with the way his breathing sounded.</p>
			<p>"Ah." He said.</p>
			<p>"But either way, we're here, on the same bench we came out to each other on, or kinda did, sort of, you know what I mean." I said.</p>
			<p>I could tell Anthony was uncomfortable, about what I don't know, but it was most likely in part that he couldn't come to look at me.</p>
			<p>"Are you okay?" He asked. I was very confused</p>
			<p>"Yes. I'm fine." I answered for all three ways he could be asking the question.</p>
			<p>"Great." he commented.</p>
			<p>There was another pause as I waited for him to talk.</p>
			<p>"I never said sorry to you, for what happened." he told me.</p>
			<p>"You don't have to." I said.</p>
			<p>"Why not?" he asked.</p>
			<p>"I'm just as much to blame." I said.</p>
			<p>"That doesn't change that I'm sorry for what *I* did." he said.</p>
			<p>"And that doesn't change the fact that you don't have to apologize."</p>
			<p>"Fair."</p>
			<p>I sighed, it was my turn to talk. "For the last two years, I have spent a copious amount of time drawing. Whatever I'm thinking I just draw it. A lot of times I don't know why. When I'm done, I immediately scan the page and destroy it." He paused, "I try to figure out why I drew something, but a lot of times I find it's meaningless, or I drew it only for my pleasure."</p>
			<p>I looked off into the distance of the park. "I write." Anthony said. "The same sort of thing applies to me. I write randomly, all over the place. A lot of time It's intimate." He paused, "I publish them online; anonymously of course."</p>
			<p>"Neat." I said. I didn't know what to say. If he wasn't being careful enough I would have found them by now I guess. I kept drawing his face.</p>
			<p>"Do you still like me, even somewhat?" I asked.</p>
			<p>"Yeah." He said. I tried not to find that weird. "I've tried to move on, but, I've just never been able to find someone. I've been on a few dates, but never further."</p>
			<p>I thought about what to say, and I understood what I wanted to, but I couldn't put it into words very well, so I just skipped to saying the closest thing I could: "Nothing has ever compared to you, just, touching me, holding me." I paused. "There was a sense of security I felt with you, a sense of trust I had with you that literally nobody else has ever given to me."</p>
			<p>"And I broke that." Anthony said.</p>
			<p>"We both did." I reiterated.</p>
			<p>I kept drawing. Neither of us said anything, nor looked at each other.</p>
			<p>https://soundcloud.com/tessaviolet/bored-1</p>
			<p>"I'm so bored of waking up"... Anthony slowly sang. "I'm so bored..."</p>
			<p>I stopped drawing.</p>
			<p>"... bo-ored of what's in-side my cup." I cut in at the same slow pace "I'm so bored; bored of bein' all a-lone"</p>
			<p>Anthony had stopped singing when I started, but continued at the next line: "Just hopin' I found pour-pose in these pic-tures on my pho-o-o-one."</p>
			<p>"You know that song." Anthony said.</p>
			<p>"Yeah," I said, "It's a great song."</p>
			<p>I had finished my drawing enough anyway before the whole singing part happened; I tore it out of my notebook and placed it where I was sitting after I stood up. "I hope you find someone." He said.</p>
			<p>"I hope you do too." Anthony said.</p>
			<p>I walked away.</p>
			<p>I tried not to cry, and was only mostly successful.</p>
