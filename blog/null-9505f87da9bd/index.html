			<p>I think one of the most interesting moments in my life was when I confessed who I was to Ms. Northington</p>
			<p>I told her what my family did for a living. She didn’t know already like a lot of the other kids in similar places; she kept it a secret. In that moment I think that we both connected beyond what we had before with anyone else.</p>
			<p>This was when she told me about the complaints that Tyler’s parents made, and what Tyler himself didn’t say.</p>
			<p>And I think, even for just a few seconds, she actually got it, she actually felt what I had been feeling for years. She got what it was like to finallyfind someone I could actually connect with, who didn’t just say that people are more accepting or something.</p>
			<p>I don’t know why.</p>
			<p>And that was the first time I saw a grown woman cry.</p>
