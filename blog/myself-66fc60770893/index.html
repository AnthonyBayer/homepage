			<p>Jessica, Kyle, Samantha, and I sat at a table meant for six people - there were two seats empty.</p>
			<p>"There's a game tonight." Kyle said; not informing anyone: Jessica, Kyle and I were all on the basketball team, and Samantha is a cheerleader.</p>
			<p>"What about it?" Samantha asked, after she swallowed what food was in her mouth.</p>
			<p>"Nothing," Kyle answered, "We just weren't talking so I thought we'd say something."</p>
			<p>Samantha responded: "Oh."</p>
			<p>The four of us continued our eating with the mildly-loud sound of people talking around us. "Yeah why are we quiet, we're never this quiet." I commented.</p>
			<p>Everyone acknowledged what I said and continued eating.</p>
			<p>"I have a date" Samantha said.</p>
			<p>"Ooooh" Jessica said.</p>
			<p>"She'll be at the game tonight." Samantha added. "We're gonna go to dinner before."</p>
			<p>We kept eating.</p>
