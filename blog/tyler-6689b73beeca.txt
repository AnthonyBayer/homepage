Tyler and I were sitting on opposite sides of a steel-framed wooden table. Tyler looked into my eyes, I tried to look into his but his glasses were reflecting the colors of the sunset that were reflecting off of the windows all around us, so I couldn't judge where his eyes were enough to make it look weird if I tried to. Instead my eyes followed down to his neck, then his pink shirt, that was buttoned up all the way to the collar.
"My eyes are up here." Tyler said, as he took his glasses of, maybe because he knew I couldn't see through them, or because they glared to much in his eyes.
I looked up at him without commenting on the fact that I couldn't see him before. "So," Tyler said, "what did you want to talk about?"
"Oh, yeah." I said.
I got ready for what I was about to say, "I'm... not gonna say anything specific in case I am wrong, but... I just want you to know that I am going through what you are, and I am here for you."
There was a silence. The silence drew me to attention to the people walking by us, none of which were listening. Tyler looked down and to the right. He breathed in and paused a little bit before looking back at me.
Tyler somehow looked more into my eyes.
"I have... been experimenting more with who I am and my sexuality recently, and I've been becoming more comforable with myself." Tyler and I found a new comfort in each other, "I'm here for you too." Tyler said.
