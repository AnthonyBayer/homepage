Tyler didnâ€™t wait for me.
I just watched as he left me at the bar for the dance floor.
I sipped on my rum and coke. He conservatively smiled at me before he started moving aimlessly at the song. I watched him forget where he was, who he was with.
He was so cute.
If you have as much money as I do, you can be anyone; we had false Identities, few all the way to Berlin just for this night.
That night, we were ourselves.
