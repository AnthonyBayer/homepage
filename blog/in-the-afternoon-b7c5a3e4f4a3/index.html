			<p>Ms. Northington was sitting still in her office chair looking off into the distance. I was sitting on the corner of her wooden desk looking down on her. She was quietly reflecting on herself.</p>
			<p>"What on Earth were you trying to do?" I asked her. She didn't say anything. I looked around her office. Almost empty - which didn't matter, she did everything on her computer. There was a couch next to the door, and the place where someone would sit at her desk was in the opposite corner. Behind her was a wall completely made of glass looking up onto the LA skyline. "Nice view. I didn't notice it the last time I was in here." I commented. "Oh, yeah," She swiveled around and tried to distract herself, "It's beautiful."</p>
			<p>"Anyway," I got back to what I was doing, "What were you trying to do?" I firmly asked.</p>
			<p>"I don't... I don't know."</p>
			<p>"What do you mean, 'you don't know'?"</p>
			<p>"I mean: 'I don't know.'" She insisted. "Okay..." She prepared herself to argue, "Do you <i>really</i> think I am into your mother?"</p>
			<p>"You're like the fourth person who's asked me that today."</p>
			<p>"...What?"</p>
			<p>"Okay, like the <i>third</i>."</p>
			<p>She shook her head in confusion "Hold on, that was-"</p>
			<p>"But I know you, okay? You had to have had some greater intention."</p>
			<p>"But I didn't. I just... I just felt something and acted on it. I wasn't in control of myself..."</p>
