			<p>My reflection stared back at me. I was wearing tight almost-blue black pants, canvass shoes that were colored the same way, a yellow, with a gray plaid pattern, button up shirt, a dark-gray wool jacket with two columns of large buttons, and a gray tie with a trinity knot.</p>
			<p>The bathroom I was standing in was quite large, yet seemed to use every inch of its space without yield, making it ultimately seem like the normal size for a bathroom with just a toilet and a sink. I leaned hard against the marble sink sitting on top of a wooden counter. I looked at myself,  into myself, at what I was. Then I snapped back into reality.</p>
			<p>I stood up, and left the bathroom and walked out into the yard. There there were about a hundred and fifty well-dressed people of various races and ages celebrating.</p>
			<p>What were they celebrating? My cousin got married, to her husband</p>
			<p>I walked over to the bar and ordered a glass of "whatever red wine is most convenient". Olivia walked up to me and leaned against the bar. She was wearing a semi-loose but well fit thick white dress that went over only her right shoulder. Her hair was wrapped around to rest on the front of her left shoulder.</p>
			<p>"I hear you brought a friend" She said, talking about Ben, also passively pushing me to say more.</p>
			<p>"Yeah," I said, but I didn't know what to say further.</p>
			<p>Olivia elaborated, "Is he anything more?" Egging me on more. "... There's benefits." I said.</p>
			<p>Olivia laughed a cheerfulish laugh, "Nice" She smiled.</p>
			<p>"Anything for you?" the bartender asked pouring my wine. "Oh," She realized that she was standing at the bar, "No, thanks." He handed me my glass of wine, and I took a sip. It was very sweet for a wine, and had some sort of citrus in it.</p>
			<p>Olivia looked like she was about to leave. "Well, Anthony. I hope you have fun." She said before leaving to socialize.</p>
