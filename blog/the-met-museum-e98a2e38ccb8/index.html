			<p>"It looks like a drunk man peed paint on a canvass and then tried to paint over it." Jessica declared.</p>
			<p>I stared up at the painting from the bench. The painting was a huge mess of paint that sang a harmony of balance.</p>
			<p>"How's the high?" Jessica asked, "It's..." I felt like I had so much energy yet no motivation to use any of it. "It's good."</p>
			<p>"You've really never done weed before?"</p>
			<p>I stared at the painting for a few seconds before replying, "There's a first for everything, Jessica."</p>
			<p>"I guess that's right. What do you think of the painting?"</p>
			<p>"It's beautiful... How can something so messy be so complete and harmonious?"</p>
			<p>"I gave you a quarter brownie, are you okay?"</p>
			<p>"It's not the weed. It's... It's just so beautiful..."</p>
			<p>I examined every single corner, stroke, and color of the painting. "Maybe... messiness is part of beauty... Nothing beautiful is perfect - everything beautiful is fucked up just a tiny bit..."</p>
			<p>"so maybe the perfect thing is the most fucked up thing you can imagine..." Jessica finished.</p>
