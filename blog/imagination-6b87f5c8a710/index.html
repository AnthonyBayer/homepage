			<p>I stretched a little bit before I got started, and then stalled myself for some reason. The only light was the little bit left from the setting sun which came in through my window.</p>
			<p>I was always cold naked - and it was almost night and winter, so i was almost freezing; but, for now, I liked the feeling. I reflected on myself for a bit, if I was really going to do this, why I was even considering it, but I conceded, and got down on my knees on the hardwood floor.</p>
			<p>Close in front of me was a dildo that I had placed there a minute prior, and bought and hour prior.</p>
			<p>I grabbed a small bottle of lube on my bed with my left hand, and drizzled some into my right hand. I slathered plenty that was in my right hand onto the dildo, and then used the rest to jack myself off slightly to get myself started - I had to resist the urge to finish myself that way. I shuffled forward on my legs, and then sat back as I grabbed the base of the dildo to try and stabilize me - it didn't work - I ended up falling on my side.</p>
			<p>I carefully moved back to where I was before, moving in slight amounts. I started to sit back, and then the dildo pushed into me. I kept going as slowly as I could.</p>
			<p>It felt so weird, and almost painful. I kept lowering myself down. My legs shook slightly with how hard it was to hover off the ground like I was.</p>
			<p>I went down all the way. It still felt so weird. I pulled myself back up to where about an inch and a half was still in me. I paused for a fraction of a second, and then continued.</p>
			<p>Slowly, I went up and down. I did not go down all the way, but I had to keep myself from going too far up and having to go through the whole process of getting the dildo back in me. I didn't feel any pain anymore since I had adjusted myself. I sped up. Pleasure started to flood into my pelvic area, and then up my chest.</p>
			<p>I sped up. The feeling still felt weird, but I was more focused on the pleasure. My heart rate and breathing increased.</p>
			<p>It felt so weird to like this, not that it was wrong, but that it was unnatural, if that makes sense.</p>
			<p>But then my imagination kicked in. I looked down at Anthony, who was naked, lying back taking in my performance with his dick. I remember thinking that if Anthony was real, my knees would have been inside his chest.</p>
			<p>I was completely unfocused on my surroundings, and was only focused on my imaginary Anthony and how fucking tired my legs were.</p>
			<p>I wanted so badly to finish myself off, so I again used my right hand to jack myself off, and eventually reached my climax ten or so seconds after.</p>
