			<p>"And how many of you are there?"</p>
			<p>"Just two." I answered.</p>
			<p>The librarian moved her mouse, clicked, hit the "2" key on her numpad, and then the enter key.</p>
			<p>Okay, you get room 17, which is on the right behind this set of shelves. She pointed towards her right.</p>
			<p>"Thanks."</p>
			<p>Samantha and I headed towards the room. We walked through a row of books, and a row of workstations.</p>
			<p>"So what's your idea again?" I asked. "I wanted to research into the global effect of the French Revolution, like what happened to thought and culture after it."</p>
			<p>I opened the door. "Cool, I like it."</p>
			<p>In the room were two workstations on the wall with the door, each with a mouse, two 4k monitors, and a USB-C to plug into our laptops which connected to the monitors, a mouse, power, ethernet, and USBs in the desk. I sat down on the left station, she sat down at the right.</p>
			<p>We plugged the USB-C into our laptops. The monitors came to life, displaying empty desktops.</p>
			<p>Samantha pulled up her notes, "This is what I have already. We just need a more coherent timeline and insight and a works cited and a conclusion and a-."</p>
			<p>"Hey," I got Samantha's attention, "Are you okay?"</p>
			<p>"Yeah." She said, well aware about what I was talking about. "Why?"</p>
			<p>"I don't know, I just think that I should check, that's all."</p>
			<p>"Thanks, but, don't. I don't wanna think about it."</p>
			<p>She was obviously disrupted by the thought.</p>
			<p>She didn't respond.</p>
			<p>I did something on my laptop I don't remember for a few seconds and then looked at her. She looked at me.</p>
			<p>She leaned towed me, I leaned towed her, and we kissed. She lightly touched the bottom of my chin with her right hand.</p>
			<p>Her curly hair lightly brushed up against my arms. I pulled away.</p>
			<p>"What was that for?" I asked.</p>
			<p>"I don't know. I just felt like it." She looked down at the ground in shame, then back up at me. "let's get back to work."</p>
