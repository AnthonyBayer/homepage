			<p>10 players ran down the court, half trying to stop a shot from being made, the other half trying to make one.</p>
			<p>"Hey, Anthony!" Austin half-shouted at me, trying to keep watch of the game. "Do you think we should switch defenses?" He asked.</p>
			<p>I continued to watch the game, "Wait sorry, what? I wasn't listening." I said back. The players ran back down the court.</p>
			<p>"Do you think we should change our defense?" He reiterated.</p>
			<p>I thought about it, "Why?"</p>
			<p>"Because they keep shooting down low. Should we switch to like, a 2-3 or something?"</p>
			<p>I thought about it, "No."</p>
			<p>"Why?"</p>
			<p>"They're not shooting from down low because we're not defending it enough, they're doing that because its the easiest place to shoot in a man defense. They'd just shoot 3 pointers if we went to a 2-3, that's the whole reason were not doing that."</p>
			<p>"Oh." He said.</p>
			<p>The ball went out of bounds, and then quickly back into play.</p>
			<p>"How have you been?" Austin asked.</p>
			<p>"Fine." I replied, kinda not in any specific way.</p>
			<p>"Oh." he said to himself, "How has the computer class been going?" He asked, trying to carry on a conversation.</p>
			<p>"Pretty good. We've been doing PHP stuff."</p>
			<p>"Okay."</p>
			<p>"How has Theater been going?" I asked.</p>
			<p>"Good. We're doing try-outs for our yearly play; We're doing <i>The Crucible</i>. Your sister's trying out for Elizabeth."</p>
			<p>"I don't know what that is. I'll ask her though."</p>
			<p>We continued to watch the game.</p>
