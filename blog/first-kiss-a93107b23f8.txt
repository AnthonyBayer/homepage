"And how many of you are there?"
"Just two." I answered.
The librarian moved her mouse, clicked, hit the "2" key on her numpad, and then the enter key.
Okay, you get room 17, which is on the right behind this set of shelves. She pointed towards her right.
"Thanks."
Samantha and I headed towards the room. We walked through a row of books, and a row of workstations.
"So what's your idea again?" I asked. "I wanted to research into the global effect of the French Revolution, like what happened to thought and culture after it."
I opened the door. "Cool, I like it."
In the room were two workstations on the wall with the door, each with a mouse, two 4k monitors, and a USB-C to plug into our laptops which connected to the monitors, a mouse, power, ethernet, and USBs in the desk. I sat down on the left station, she sat down at the right.
We plugged the USB-C into our laptops. The monitors came to life, displaying empty desktops.
Samantha pulled up her notes, "This is what I have already. We just need a more coherent timeline and insight and a works cited and a conclusion and a-."
"Hey," I got Samantha's attention, "Are you okay?"
"Yeah." She said, well aware about what I was talking about. "Why?"
"I don't know, I just think that I should check, that's all."
"Thanks, but, don't. I don't wanna think about it."
She was obviously disrupted by the thought.
She didn't respond.
I did something on my laptop I don't remember for a few seconds and then looked at her. She looked at me.
She leaned towed me, I leaned towed her, and we kissed. She lightly touched the bottom of my chin with her right hand.
Her curly hair lightly brushed up against my arms. I pulled away.
"What was that for?" I asked.
"I don't know. I just felt like it." She looked down at the ground in shame, then back up at me. "let's get back to work."
