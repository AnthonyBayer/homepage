The porcelain bathtub was almost warm because of how long I had my cheek resting on it.
The sun setting over the Pacific Ocean was bright in my eyes as I stared at it - but not bright enough to blind me.
The room-temperature water soaked into my calm, naked body. I felt like I wanted to add more hot water, or something.
And here I was - drunk and high off my mind - all alone in my ginormous, empty house.
I wanted to cry, but I couldn't; I didn't have the energy to.
