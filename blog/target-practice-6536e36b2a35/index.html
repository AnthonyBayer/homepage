			<p>The handgun felt heavy, but was easy to hold. It was solid metal, cold, and dark.</p>
			<p>I inspected the gun for safety. The clip was inserted properly, there were not any worrying scratches or damage, it was good.</p>
			<p>I aimed the gun at the target poster, a generic body silhouette with a red oval in the center of the chest and lines in orderly distances around it. I turned the safety off.</p>
			<p>I shot my first shot, a single loud bang, followed by a minimal echo. I hit the upper left part of number seven, not bad for my first, usually I miss the body and just hit the white part of the poster.</p>
			<p>I shot again, an eight this time, but to the upper-right.</p>
			<p>Another shot, hit on the red, and another, and another directly to the torso.</p>
			<p>I focused more. I adjusted right a small bit, directly to the heart, and another, and another, and another.</p>
			<p>I aimed up, I hit the upper neck, then the forehead, then directly on the face.</p>
			<p>I shot again, directly to the face. The sound started to numb. I shot again, and again both to the head. Anger brewed within me.</p>
			<p>I shot another time, straight on the bridge of the nose.</p>
			<p>I had one bullet left, I stopped, and leaned against the wall in front of me. I breathed, and cried.</p>
			<p>I put the gun to the underside of my head, and hovered over the trigger. I felt I was a failure. I felt hopeless.</p>
			<p>I pulled the trigger. I didn't even hear the gunshot.</p>
