<a href="../../signatures">How to verify signatures</a>.</pre>
			<p>When I first created Anthony, I did it online by signing up for a Protonmail account so that I could fuck around on the dark web mostly anonymously.</p>
			<p>Not that I was doing anything explicit, I just loved (and still love) computers and the internet - and liked the feeling and the excitement of being on the dark web.</p>
			<p>I've already told the story of how I met Tim, so I'll keep it brief. We met on a dark web version of Omegle, and then both found out we were gay. We exchanged Protonmail emails, and messaged each other every so often from then on.</p>
			<p>And then I started writing stories.</p>
			<p>I've tried to find the first stories I wrote, but I deleted them along with my Medium account, and couldn't find them anywhere on any archive or backup. But I started writing them in early 2018, when I first met the real version of Tyler.</p>
			<p>And ever since then I've tried to publish stories around once a week, and I've recently had trouble doing that.</p>
			<p>The stories are, of course, very loosely based off of what my reality actually is. I do use my experiences but most everything is just a fiction that I use to protect myself (and the people I write about), make my points on those issues more interesting, and to attempt to make a barrier between reality and the stories. I've broken that barrier again.</p>
			<p>I guess it can be attributed to my recent isolation from my friends and whomever I currently have a crush on from school, or just Summer. But either way, I've broken the barrier, and I've kinda gone back to using the characters for reasons beyond what I'm supposed to.</p>
			<p>Once in a while I actually look at my website, and then notice how weird the characters page is. There seems to be no use for it, because I still write all my stories as if the characters do not have a physical form of any kind. I created the page as another barrier to keep me knowing that the stories aren't real. The characters I write about are not in any way their real life counterparts.</p>
			<p>It's almost like the fact that I need that is a story in itself.</p>
