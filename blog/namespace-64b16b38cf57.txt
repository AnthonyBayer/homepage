It happens so suddenly, yet takes forever to set in.
It's like going away for summer, or remembering someone who moved away.
I become detached from myself. my senses senses become information, not part of my surroundings.
I drift into my thoughts and memories. Everything that has happened is happening and everything that is happening has happened.
I find patterns you never seen before, causes, effects, reason, chaos, love, prejudice.
The world seems meaningless, and we seem to just be making it more chaotic.
And then I finally take back control, and return to the world.
And then I think, "I'm so happy to be here with you."
