			<p>I drank a bit more of my bourbon. It tasted sweet, but still had the bitter hard taste of alcoholic drinks.</p>
			<p>A woman with black somewhat curly hair sat down in the empty stool next to me, "A neat old forester, please." she said without looking at a menu.</p>
			<p>I stared off into the distance, now thoughtless and empty. "Hey." She said. I didn't realize she was trying to get my attention.</p>
			<p>"Hello?" She said again. I still was zoned out.</p>
			<p>"Hey." She said, loud enough to get my attention. "Are you talking to me?" I asked.</p>
			<p>"Yes." She answered.</p>
			<p>I stared at her as she looked like she expected me to say something.</p>
			<p>"Do you want something?" I asked.</p>
			<p>"Sorry, I had this whole dramatic thing planed and-" The bartender set her drink down, "Thanks. I had this dramatic thing planned but that moment of awkwardness was just <i>really</i> distracting."</p>
			<p>"I'm- A- What?" I responded.</p>
			<p>"Just listen to me for a few seconds."</p>
			<p>"Okay..."</p>
			<p>"I'm breaking a ton of laws and putting myself in a lot of danger even being in proximity to you; but I just wanted you to know that he loved you; and that it wasn't your fault."</p>
			<p>My confusion changed to fear, and existentialism. "Who the fuck <i>are</i> you?" I asked in a slightly rude tone.</p>
			<p>"Oh come on, Anthony," She responded, "If he was even a slight bit honest about who you were; I wouldn't need you to answer that question."</p>
			<p>She drank her entire glass of whiskey and set it down on the bar. "Thanks for the drink. Good luck on your game tomorrow." She swiftly and calmly left.</p>
			<p>I tried not to to think about it; but I could think about nothing more.</p>
