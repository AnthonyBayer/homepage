“Are we going to talk about it?” I asked Ben as he stuffed his face with a hand roll.
“Talk about what?” He said with his mouth half full.
“I don’t know, just about us.”
“What is there to talk about” he insisted.
“The relationship between us. I feel like you’re not enjoying it”
“What do you mean? I’m enjoying being with you.”
“Yeah but… I don’t know how to explain it, I just think you’re getting bored.”
“I’m not, you just think that I am.”
“What?” I said. Followed by some silence.
“You have to remember, Anthony, I don’t like you. I’m heteroromatic. We’re friends, who just like to have fun together.”
Ben took another bite of his food.
