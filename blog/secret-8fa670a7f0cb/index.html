			<p>This party was surreal. I'm am not used to being around people right now, let alone 420 of them. I know that everyone was tested negative twice with some super accurate and super expensive test, but I still feel uncomfortable. The other Americans I talked to share my feelings, people from other countries too but a bit less so. I've been inside the vault one time before, and this time it seems to be more busy if anything.</p>
			<p>We were in this sort of a very large plaza in the center of the city, and had been their for about two hours mingling.</p>
			<p>I heard a suspiciously loud glass klink towards center of the plaza. Mr. Sanchez was standing on top of the ledge of a fountain, preparing to say some words. Everyone quieted down as Mr. Sanchez cleared his throat, his voice amplified through the plaza.</p>
			<p>"My father always told me that this celebration replaced his birthday, because like a birthday, it is a celebration of how lucky we are to have survived this long. Seventy years ago, my father created the idea of The Insurance Company, and since then he and I have worked hard to change it to what it is today: both the world's best kept secret, and an organization for good. My father was a good man, and without his dedication to altruism, none of us would be here, at a party in a town square three kilometers underground during a pandemic."</p>
			<p>Mr. Sanchez and the crowd chuckled.</p>
			<p>"Everything about The Insurance Company is ridiculous, and I wouldn't trade it for anything else." Mr. Sanchez paused, and held up his glass, "Here's to the last seventy years, and the hope we will survive in the future."</p>
