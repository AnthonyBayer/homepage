			<p>Tyler and I were sitting on opposite sides of a steel-framed wooden table. Tyler looked into my eyes, I tried to look into his but his glasses were reflecting the colors of the sunset that were reflecting off of the windows all around us, so I couldn't judge where his eyes were enough to make it look weird if I tried to. Instead my eyes followed down to his neck, then his pink shirt, that was buttoned up all the way to the collar.</p>
			<p>"My eyes are up here." Tyler said, as he took his glasses off, maybe because he knew I couldn't see through them, or because they glared to much in his eyes.</p>
			<p>I looked up at him without commenting on the fact that I couldn't see him before. "So," Tyler said, "what did you want to talk about?"</p>
			<p>"Oh, yeah." I said.</p>
			<p>I got ready for what I was about to say, "I'm... not gonna say anything specific in case I am wrong, but... I just want you to know that I am going through what you are, and I am here for you."</p>
			<p>There was a silence. The silence drew me to attention to the people walking by us, none of which were listening. Tyler looked down and to the right. He breathed in and paused a little bit before looking back at me.</p>
			<p>Tyler somehow looked more into my eyes.</p>
			<p>"I have... been experimenting more with who I am and my sexuality recently, and I've been becoming more comforable with myself." Tyler and I found a new comfort in each other, "I'm here for you too." Tyler said.</p>
