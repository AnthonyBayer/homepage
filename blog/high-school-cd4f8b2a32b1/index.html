			<p>Ms. Northington walked through the door that was just violently swung into the bathroom. Four girls leaned against the wall in a corner. One was texting on her phone, and another, Beverly, quickly hid something behind her back.</p>
			<p>"Hey..? Ms. Northington..." She said. All the girls except the one texting looked at her with a scared and confused look.</p>
			<p>Ms. Northinton walked up to Beverly and put her hand out. "Give it to me." Ms. Northington demanded. She reluctantly gave Ms. Northington a blunt. "Wait," Ms. Northington started, "I thought you guys were vaping. Why are you guys smoking weed? It's eleven thirty."</p>
			<p>There was a very brief awkward silence.</p>
			<p>"Ah whatever." Ms. Northington smoked the blunt a bit and handed it back to Beverly. "That's good, where'd you get that?"</p>
			<p>"I'm not telling you." Beverly talked back.</p>
			<p>"Oh, right. I'm the principal." She said. The girls minus the one texting looked at her. "It's been a long day."</p>
			<p>"It's like... eleven thirty." The girl who was texting pointed out. "I KNOW!" Ms. Northington laugh-yell-cried.</p>
			<p>There was another way longer and more awkward moment of awkward silence.</p>
			<p>"Okay," Beverly started, "Excuse my language, but, what the fuck do you want?"</p>
			<p>"Information. You're friends with Tyler, right?"</p>
			<p>"Yeah..."</p>
			<p>"Do you know who Anthony is?"</p>
			<p>"There's like nine "Anthony"s in the school.."</p>
			<p>"Anthony Bayer, from the basketball team."</p>
			<p>"Yeah."</p>
			<p>"Have you seen them together?"</p>
			<p>Beverly thought about it. The incessant noise of the fake keyboard sounds were starting to annoy Ms. Northington. "Why would I tell you that?" She asked.</p>
			<p>"Because underage consumption of legal drugs is punishable with up to 2 weeks of suspension and 1 extra week of detention."</p>
			<p>Another moment of awkward silence.</p>
			<p>"I saw them together once after one of the games I went to with him. He went to the bathroom during halftime ended and then I saw them talking when I went to the bathroom myself."</p>
			<p>"Okay." Ms. Northington finished, "Thanks."</p>
