# 2020 04 08: He Noticed

I have this one photo that I keep in a special folder in my pictures appropriately called "Favorites".
It's one out of five photos that I look at whenever I feel like; but I always look at this photo more than the others.
It's a picture of Tyler, but one he may or may not have noticed me taking.
I was sitting on the other side of the table pretending to be on my phone when I took it of him; he looked at my phone, right at the camera lens, for a split second when I took it, and then looked up at my face.
And I still don't know if he thought I was taking a picture of him or not.
But it doesn't matter, because he either enjoyed me taking a picture of him, or was looking at me just because.
And I love that.
