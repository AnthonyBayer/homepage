There's an individual feeling for everything.
We tend to describe things as the typical emotions and descriptions we have - happy, angry, wet, smooth.
But they fail to describe the specifics that are sometimes necessary.
So imagine: 25 people, at various stages of drunkenness and overhangness.
Golden silverware, $500 plates, $5000 bottles of wine.
And a fear of heights 1000 feet into the San Fransisco skyline.
So what do I feel?
