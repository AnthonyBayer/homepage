			<p>Anthony looked at me. "Hello. He said.</p>
			<p>"Hello." I said back.</p>
			<p>Anthony seemed confused, "Yeah sorry, I didn't really know how else to start this." I said.</p>
			<p>Anthony seemed more confused, "Wha-</p>
			<p>"I should probably introduce myself. I'm the writer, and creator of this world."</p>
			<p>Normally Anthony would disregard me as a crazy person, then politely kill the conversation and move on - but not now - because I made him stay. "Sorry, <i>what</i>?" he said.</p>
			<p>"Don't worry about it." I commanded. "Okay." he followed, but not before he took a sip of his tequila and watermelon juice.</p>
			<p>"I would like to just say a few short words." I said.</p>
			<p>"Okay." Anthony said, confused why I had to specify.</p>
			<p>"So, Anthony; in short you're me, kind of." I said. He listened closely.</p>
			<p>"I created you as a way, actually more like a place, for me to hash out my emotions in my life. The first, and only other time I have spoken as myself in these stories, I made it seem like the whole thing was started just to talk with Tim, but I actually made you way before that.</p>
			<p>"I had an idea of you well before I met Tim. You're basically my alter ego; and I'm surprised to say that I'm jealous of you,"</p>
			<p>Anthony kept listening. He drank his drink more.</p>
			<p>"...and that's unhealthy." I continued. Anthony looked directly into my eyes.</p>
			<p>"I feel like I'm trying to be you, and in doing so I'm adopting your individual problems."</p>
			<p>"Tyler is the central focus of these stories, both Kyle Hosch and Ben Kempsity are the exact same person as Tyler - just different timelines." I forgot where I was going; I hesitated; this was not a problem for anyone but myself, "I recently reread all of my stories, and I realized just how much I can't let Tyler go -  and I need to.</p>
			<p>"When you loose someone unexpectedly, you don't actually know how you're going to react to it. Your body has no time to prepare. I reacted by creating another version of Tyler." I stopped talking I stared forward at the skyline for a hot second. "Tyler is still going to be a character in these stories - I just need to write it out - because again: these stories honestly help me. And I want to continue it... I just need to step into reality for a little bit."</p>
			<p>I stopped talking, and just looked at Anthony.</p>
			<p>I laughed.</p>
