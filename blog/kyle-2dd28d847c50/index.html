			<p>Kyle sat across from me at the other head of my dining table. He had a half-empty beer bottle loosely grasped in his right hand. The sun filled the room though the giant windows. Kyle was blankly staring off to my right. "Kyle?" I said to get his attention. "What-" he exclaimed as he quickly looked at me. Sorry, I zoned out. What were we talking about?" he asked.</p>
			<p>"You were talking about something that happened at school."</p>
			<p>"Oh, yeah," He said, then stared blankly past my face.</p>
			<p>"Kyle!" I got his attention again.</p>
			<p>"Sorry," he said, shaken out of his thought, "I just don't know how to say it."</p>
			<p>I sighed as I thought for a bit, "How was your day?" I asked.</p>
			<p>"What?" Kyle was confused what I was doing.</p>
			<p>"Just trust me, answer it."</p>
			<p>Kyle shrugged, "Fine, I guess. I did shooting practice with the other Kyle on the team."</p>
			<p>I distracted him more, "How was that?"</p>
			<p>"Great, I don't know. It wasn't really anything."</p>
			<p>So, why are you here?" I asked.</p>
			<p>He thought about it and then mentally said, "fuck it" in his head.</p>
			<p>"I had sex" he said, "Oh!" I said, "...with Ms. Northington." he said.</p>
			<p>"...Oh..." I said.</p>
			<p>"Yeah." He said, nodding with a contradictory humorous tone.</p>
			<p>I looked at him and waited for a reaction or something - he did the same.</p>
			<p>"Why?"</p>
			<p>"Why what?" he asked, offended.</p>
			<p>"Why did you have sex with her?"</p>
			<p>"I don't... I don't know..."</p>
			<p>"Okay." I said. "You don't have to answer that."</p>
			<p>We looked at each other. Kyle's expression was a mix of anger and comfort.</p>
			<p>Kyle drank a bit more of his beer.</p>
			<p>"I just..." he shook his head. "I don't know... It was an in-the-moment sort of thing."</p>
			<p>"Do you want to do anything about it?"</p>
			<p>"No. It's not like anyone will believe me."</p>
			<p>I looked at him.</p>
			<p>"I'm a guy, and she's a woman. Absolutely nobody will believe that." He said, holding back his anger.</p>
