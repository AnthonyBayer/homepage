Kyle sat across from me at the other head of my dining table. He had a half-empty beer bottle loosely grasped in his right hand. The sun filled the room though the giant windows. Kyle was blankly staring off to my right. "Kyle?" I said to get his attention. "What-" he exclaimed as he quickly looked at me. Sorry, I zoned out. What were we talking about?" he asked.
"You were talking about something that happened at school."
"Oh, yeah," He said, then stared blankly past my face.
"Kyle!" I got his attention again.
"Sorry," he said, shaken out of his thought, "I just don't know how to say it."
I sighed as I thought for a bit, "How was your day?" I asked.
"What?" Kyle was confused what I was doing.
"Just trust me, answer it."
Kyle shrugged, "Fine, I guess. I did shooting practice with the other Kyle on the team."
I distracted him more, "How was that?"
"Great, I don't know. It wasn't really anything."
So, why are you here?" I asked.
He thought about it and then mentally said, "fuck it" in his head.
"I had sex" He said, "Oh!" I said, "...with Ms. Northington." he said,
"...Oh..." I said.
"Yeah." he said, nodding with a contradictory humorous tone.
I looked at him and waited for a reaction or something - he did the same.
"Why?"
"Why what?" he asked, offended.
"Why did you have sex with her?"
"I don't... I don't know..."
"Okay." I said. "You don't have to answer that."
We looked at each other. Kyle's expression was a mix of anger and comfort.
Kyle drank a bit more of his beer.
"I just..." he shook his head. "I don't know... It was an in-the-moment sort of thing."
"Do you want to do anything about it?"
"No. It's not like anyone will believe me."
I looked at him.
"I'm a guy, and she's a woman. Absolutely nobody will believe that." He said, holding back his anger.
