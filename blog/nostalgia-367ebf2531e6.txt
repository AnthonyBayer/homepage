The wind blew my hair as the car sped down the straight open New Mexico roads - running from and to the unknown.
I laid back, for so long now I was almost tired of it. The happy, snappy 80s-styled music from the one cassete I owned played through the car; it's beat synced up with the natural way of my body and my thoughts.
I looked over at you as you forced our nearally broken down car from running off the road.
I kept looking at you, your cute mildly-hunky body, and your cute nose.
The past the present the future all came running back to me. Who am I? Where am I?
I thought about everything in the past and the future. I felt a moment of nostalgia, and fear.
Where will I go next?
