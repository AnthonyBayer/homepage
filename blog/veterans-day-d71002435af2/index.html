			<p>Jessica was in the backyard talking to Max Thornhill, a classmate of ours. "I think that she's a good fit for you, but I just think she's a total- Oh hey, Anthony."</p>
			<p>"Hello, Jessica. Hello, Max." I said. "What were you guys talking about?"</p>
			<p>"I got a girlfriend" Max said. "She's a freshmen - her name is Samantha, you might know her."</p>
			<p>"I do not." I said.</p>
			<p>"Don't take this the wrong way, but who are you?" Max asked me.</p>
			<p>"Oh, Jessica and I have known each other for a few years, we went to middle school together. I know you though, you're Max Thornhill."</p>
			<p>"Oh cool. Wait, how do you know who I am?"</p>
			<p>"I learn names and faces really easily, I must've overheard someone saying your name to you or something."</p>
			<p>"I know Samantha," Jessica said, "Not very well though, we just have history and math together. I was just saying how I think she's a total-"</p>
			<p>"Okay, Jessica" Max said, quite annoyed, "You don't like her. I do though, she's really nice."</p>
			<p>"So you're not at all interested in her because she's a D cup?"</p>
			<p>"That's a loaded question and you know it, Jessica."</p>
			<p>"Oh right, you're speech and debate, I forgot I can't have a petty argument against you." Jessica jeered.</p>
			<p>"Well, anyway," Max said, "Nice to meet you, Anthony" He fist-bumped me,</p>
			<p>"You two wanna get a hot dog or something?"</p>
