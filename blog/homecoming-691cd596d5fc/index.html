			<p>I set the four drinks down at the table, and sat down in the seat my friends saved for me. Everyone grabbed one and drank it a little. "Fruit punch." Samantha said, "Why is the only time I ever have fruit punch is by surprise at a party?"</p>
			<p>"I.. What?" Kyle asked. "Why is the only time I ever have fuit pun-" Samantha got cut off. "No, I heard you," Kyle responded, "But it just seems kinda weird. You've never had fruit punch outside of a party?"</p>
			<p>"Have you?"</p>
			<p>Kyle shook his head, "But always by surprise?"</p>
			<p>"Yeah, I think I've only had it about four other times I can remember: my fifth birthday party, my brothers eleventh, my great-grandma's funeral, and my uncle's wedding."</p>
			<p>The silence that followed was so quiet it drowned out the music.</p>
			<p>"You have a very interesting family." I commented.</p>
			<p>"I do." She responded.</p>
			<p>Jessica finished her drink and went to dance, Kyle followed. I started to talk to Samantha. "Did you like the sushi?" I asked. "Actually, it was really good. The first time I had sushi I was six and I got food poisoning so I never ate it again, until tonight."</p>
			<p>"What was your favorite thing?"</p>
			<p>"Probably the Caterpillar roll - I love avocado."</p>
			<p>"Mine is just the straight up fish, especially salmon."</p>
			<p>We took another sip of our fruit punch.</p>
			<p>"I see Ben decided to go with a girl."</p>
			<p>"Unfortunately, I don't know why - prior commitment, fear of being seen in public…"</p>
			<p>"I don't know; just don't tell her, or anyone, that you two… you know… whatever you want to call it."</p>
			<p>We drank again.</p>
			<p>"Is he cute?" I asked.</p>
			<p>"Yeah, I'd rate him a seven."</p>
			<p>"Really, I'd do nine, minimum."</p>
			<p>"Seriously? Well, different people have different tastes."</p>
			<p>"Aren't those pants hot on him though?"</p>
			<p>"Fuck yeah, look at his ass."</p>
			<p>"I already am."</p>
			<p>"Oh man, it makes me want to turn straight again."</p>
