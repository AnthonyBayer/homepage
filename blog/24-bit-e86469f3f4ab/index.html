			<p>I clicked the shuffle button, and instantly one of the 385 tracks that were on my Favorites playlist at the time started playing in my ear. This time I got "Wonderland" by CHVRCHES.</p>
			<p>I put my phone in my right pocket and put my left arm through my backpack strap so my backpack was fully on me. The singing of the song started</p>
			<p>The elevator got to the bottom floor, and promptly opened its doors to the landing zone. I walked out of the elevator, turned left to exit the landing zone, then right and straight out the glass doors, and onto 5th St. I turned left and started walking to school - a nice ten minute walk. I do it whenever I stay at my apartment and the weather permits it.</p>
			<p>And then, precisely forty-nine seconds into the song, the chorus started, and for some reason, it hit me like a truck, but in the best way possible.</p>
			<p>I suddenly became very, very happy. And it wasn't like there was anything specific to be happy about, this day was like any other.</p>
			<p>I was just in a good mood, there is no explanation to it.</p>
			<p>Just, in that moment, I loved the music, I loved Lauren Mayberry's voice - all in perfect 24 bit lossless quality; even though it wasn't necessarily my favorite. I loved the weather, same as almost every day; I loved the sunlight; I loved who I was.</p>
			<p>Just in that moment.</p>
