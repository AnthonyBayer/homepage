I just realized that it has been over a month since I published my last story.
I have been working on something that I like, but I guess I just forgot to contuinue working on it.
Currently I have 8 stories in my queue, but for some reason I'm just not motivated to write any of them, even though I know I can do it.
Some days I feel like this project has been a failiure; other days I feel like it is the best thing I have ever done and ever will do.
