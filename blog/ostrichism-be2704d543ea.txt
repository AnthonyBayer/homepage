Tyler embraced Anthony's grasp on him. It's not that he did not want to embrace it - nor did he have any other choice. Tyler loved the feeling of someone's body pressing up against him, someone's hand around his bare chest.
Anthony's body heat soaked into Tyler; it felt like it was burning him, but he loved it. Tyler could feel Anthony's heartbeat, his followed a similar rhythm and time.
The dark room and softness overtook him, and he calmly fell asleep.
Tyler's phone, a few feet away from him, woke him up with a loud quickly-beeping tone that faded out. Tyler was further woken up by the tone sounding again.  Tyler cried in the otherwise empty bed.
